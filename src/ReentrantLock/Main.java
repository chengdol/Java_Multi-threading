// why use reentrantlock? difference with synchronized:
// http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reentrant-lock-java/
/*
 * the synchronized keyword is quite rigid in its use. For example, 
 * a thread can take a lock only once. Synchronized blocks donâ€™t 
 * offer any mechanism of a waiting queue and after the exit of one 
 * thread, any thread can take the lock. This could lead to starvation 
 * of resources for some other thread for a very long period of time.
